# Azure Streaming Solution for Realtime Weather Analysis
## Business Requirement
### Scenario
A national weather monitoring organization, aims to enhance real-time weather analysis for operational efficiency and public safety. The organization needs a robust system to ingest, process, and analyze real-time weather data from sensors distributed across the country. The processed data must provide actionable insights, such as average weather metrics, trends, and conditions, for internal stakeholders and public users.

The primary objectives are:
#### 1. Real-Time Monitoring: 
Collect and process live weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, to ensure immediate responses to severe weather events.
#### 2. Data Reliability: 
Store the streaming data with high accuracy for historical analysis and future predictions.
#### 3. Actionable Insights:
Aggregate data for trend analysis over time intervals to support decision-making.
#### 4. Public Dashboard: 
Enable visualization of real-time weather trends via an interactive dashboard for internal stakeholders and public safety alerts.

## Solution 
### Solution Overview: 
The Azure-based real-time streaming solution efficiently addresses the business requirement by leveraging structured streaming, scalable cloud services, and interactive visualizations.

#### 1. Data Ingestion with Azure Event Hub:
- The solution collects real-time weather data using Azure Event Hub with a throughput unit designed for a high volume of events.
- Data is stored temporarily for immediate streaming to processing pipelines.
#### 2. Data Processing in Azure Databricks:
- Bronze Layer: Ingests raw weather data and persists it in Delta format for reliability and reprocessing, ensuring all data is stored with exactly-once semantics.
- Silver Layer: Cleans and transforms the data, converting JSON structures into a structured tabular format with specific fields like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions.
- Gold Layer: Aggregates weather metrics into 5-minute intervals, providing summarized insights for trends and historical analysis

#### 3. Data Visualization with Power BI:
- Silver Layer Visualization: Offers near-real-time data monitoring for immediate insights.
- Gold Layer Visualization: Enables analytical dashboards with aggregated metrics, supporting trend analysis over time.

#### 4. Scalability & Fault Tolerance:
- Implemented checkpointing and Delta Lake for reliable and fault-tolerant data streaming.
- Scalable architecture allows increasing throughput units or clusters to handle spikes in sensor data volume.

#### 5. Business Outcomes:
- Enhanced Weather Awareness: Real-time data visualization enables proactive responses to changing weather conditions.
- Efficient Decision-Making: Aggregated metrics support better strategic planning for weather-dependent activities.
- Improved Public Safety: Accurate and timely weather data can trigger alerts, reducing risks associated with extreme weather.
